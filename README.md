# Udacity Homework

The following are two homework/portfolio items for the Udacity interview:

  * [A review of cs253](/doc/review_cs253.md)
  * [A unit on Virtual Computers](/doc/unit_1_vc.md)
  
I chose cs253 because it was clearly done by a skilled and knowledgeable instructor, 
but the contents seemed to be overwhelming (to the target audience) in their presentation. 

I chose 'Virtual Computers' as a unit to try to plausibly be about ten minutes long (at least for one or two parts) and
because it is a foundation to Cloud Computing: a topic people are interested in.
